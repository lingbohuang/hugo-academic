abstract: "Communication is one of the most effective devices in promoting team
  cooperation. However, asymmetric communication sometimes breeds collusion and
  hurts team efficiency. Here, we present experimental evidence showing that
  excluding one member from team communication hurts team cooperation: the
  communicating partners collude in profit allocation against the excluded
  member, and the latter reacts by exerting less effort. Allowing the partners
  to reach out to the excluded member partially restore cooperation and fairness
  in profit allocation; but it does not stop the partners from talking behind
  the that member's back even when they could have talked publicly. The partners
  sometimes game the system by tricking the excluded member into contributing
  but then grabbing all profits for themselves."
